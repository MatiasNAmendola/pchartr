NELSON RULES
------------

- Fix plot so that ylim includes ucl and lcl by default
- Add test cases for multiple series
- Fix code for consistent use of underscore or dot in variable names
- Pretty print for $which

POWER ANALYSIS
--------------

- What is the probability of detecting the out of control situation?
- How long does it take to detect the out of control situation?
- What is the probability of detecting at time one, time two, etc.?


Right now, the pchart_power function only shows the data, it will need to 
perform some analysis

- Override the print and plot functions for power results
